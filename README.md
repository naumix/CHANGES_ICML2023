## Repository associated with the paper "On Many-Actions Policy Gradient" (published in ICML 2023)

Code based on CleanRL repository (https://docs.cleanrl.dev). All files are self-contained. The code is not optimized - the implementations are correct, but there are much better ways to code them up (I hope to re-write this codebase sometime soon).
